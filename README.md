# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Software Development
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! These repository documents are for Task 1 of my internship journey, which focuses on creating innovative, simple, flexible programs.

# Task Overview
Create a program that generates random numbers and challenges the user to guess them. The program should encourage the user to input their guess, compare it To the 
generated number, and provide feedback if the gas is too high or too low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then displays the number of attempts to win the game.


# Knowledge Gained
Task 2 improved my gaming programming thought process and developed it without any confusion.
